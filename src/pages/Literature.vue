            Born in Constantinople in 1433 Constantine was the son of a high priest and pastor, named by the orthodox church, Bartholomew. Their family had a close connection to the church as they have been taking care of the local temples for generations, with his grandfather Michael, being the first of their line to become a cleric. Through the devotion shown by his father and grandfather and their popularity among the religious powerful, Bartholomeus was put in charge of their home basilica, with potential to climb even higher. Unfortunately Constantine grew up with his only family being his father, as his mother died in birth, and his grandfather of a common disease. Given the position of his family, he was lucky to be well educated and had a variety of books available to him, which he found great interest in from the very begging. He was involved in the rituals from a young age, as his father had intended for him to become a priest as well and succeed him, continuing their newly found family tradition. It wasn't hard to notice that he was the brightest among the children of his age, as he was always surprising his teachers with his view of the world.

            As the years pasted Constantine grew and so did his appetite for knowledge. At his early teenage years he was the first of the altar boys, preparing all the necessities for the rituals and guiding the others. Given the growth he has shown and his potential, he was often taken to greater temples to help so that he could gain more experience for his later years. Fortunately there were a huge supply of books nearby these temples that he could feast upon and with his growing reputation among the orthodox circles he had access to most of them. Some times as he was devouring knowledge, he would roam through dozens of books, cross-referencing events and taking the most fascinating journey someone could take in that era. One day he stumbled upon a section that was usually locked, and in a burst of his immense curiosity he grabbed one of the oddest looking books on the self. It was nothing like he had ever read before, containing information about events he was familiar with, that was hidden away. Then he took a second book, and he found even more secrets. As he went to grab a third book he felt a rapid wack on the back of his head and shortly after he saw the headmaster shouting at him. He was followed by a priest that calmed him down and explained to the boy that this section was forbidden and only the highest of the priest had access to it, and that he had to be punished for what he did. That, however, did not stop his hunger, and he would often go to such sections in secret when there was no one around, usually right after the evening ceremony.

            He began to expand his knowledge fast and with that his way of viewing things changed, he had found out that the world he lived in was nothing like it seemed, it was just a front and the truth was locked behind glass cabinets, who knows how much more was hidden. As he was often visiting places like that, he would spot such cabinets and when he had the chance he would go and take a couple of books and replace them with those widely available, remaining unnoticed. Some times he would go there in late hours and as he would read, he would overhear conversations amongst clerics that would justify what he was reading and the view he now had of the church. One of those times, as he left he passed through the temple area and saw a woman entering and approaching the high priest, she had come for confession. He remained hidden behind a door frame and within the shadows as he thought it would not be right to interrupt such ritual, and so he stayed there watching and listening to every word she said. When the woman finished, the priest asked her to kneel before him and pray, and she did so immediately. Slowly the priest started circling the woman and touching her during her prayer and as she was done, he started removing her clothes. The young teenage boy was watching as the priest started molesting the woman, he was terrified and rooted to the ground, he couldn't turn his sight away. Eventually the priest stopped and the woman left, so did the boy and no one even noticed he was even there, still holding three books he should not have in his possession.

            At the time he was near adulthood he had seen so many things that he shouldn't have, and he had read even more. He bore witness to priests taking advantage of other people because of their power, molesting women, stealing peoples money, suppressing thoughts and at the same time they would speak of morals that they would not follow them selfs. The corruption, the filth and the rot inside the highest members of the orthodox church filled his mind with anger and hate, despising everything they ever taught to him and everything they said. He would often hear priest talking about such things and bragging like it was an accomplishment, while he was still a member of the church, he had nowhere else to go, so he decided to take advantage of the situation. He had found out things that no one should know, crusades, exorcisms, and burning against innocent people just for the benefit of the church. They would mask crimes like that so many times that it became part of their every day life, and they would continue preaching like they never happened.

            One day he was in charge of the preparations in the great basilica, Hagia Sophia, as his father took the place of the priest that night, a common thing for him, and he grabbed the chance to unravel any mysteries it had hidden away. Not long after the end of the ceremony, as he was hiding and looking for information, a family came to the priest with their young boy. He knew the little one, as he had seen him in the streets with the other kids, but he stood alone, distant from the crowd. From the conversation they had, he realised that they had been taking the boy there for many years, hoping to "cure" him. They left the boy with the cleric, and they stood outside the temple waiting to escort him home after they were done. Without even letting the boy speak, without asking him anything the priest started rapping him. This happened every single week since he was but a child. He came out with visible scars and bruises, some fresh, some not and his parents would just cover him with a thin cloth and walk him home. This was the most horrendous and disgusting thing Constantine had ever seen, it filled him with absolute despair. Not only the parents knew what was happening, but they would continuously bring the traumatized child back, blindly believing a perverse man just because of his robes and his position in the church, his power. It was then he realized that this man was not his father anymore, he was never. This problem could not be solved by any way but only one. To rid the world of their existence. This was the final straw to an everlasting cycle of lies and corruption. Through the connections he had made over the years and the information he gathered he knew of a growing empire in the east. He found out that the Ottomans were heading their way and so it became clear to him. Constantinople needed to burn, so he could take his revenge for the crimes the church committed. Not long after the city was being sieged. The Fall begins.

            He didn't hide him self, enough was enough. He let the army in, and he led them to slaughter every single person they see. Everyone saw him and his cold stare as they were being murdered before him. He was just watching as the city burned and turned to rubble. His work was done, and so he had no reason to stay there. He set foot outside the great walls and stumbled upon a fleeing crowd, everyone knew that he was the source of this catastrophe but as they were running in torment no one noticed him, except an old woman. She stood there in the middle of the mass staring at him. She knew him since birth as they lived nearby, and at that moment with the screams of her people being killed and burned alive, with the darkness of the ashen sky clouding his eyes and the moon on his back, she pointed at him. "The one who we all knew and looked up upon, the one who's family was caring for the churches for generations has brought hell upon us. There for he will be known from now on as The Grave Keeper, damned to tend those who have died by his hand for eternity". He half smiled as he turned away, "This is only the beginning".

            He was young and power hungry, didn't care about anything but him self. One wrong encounter was enough to destroy all that he had built, all that he ever was. As intimidating going against a witch could sound, it was the most stupid and paranoid thing a man could do. When she had enough of his games, she warned him to stop but he wanted more. His own greed was his downfall. She put a spell on him like no other, a curse no one had ever seen before. An ache in his head was so terrible he could tear his face of with his own hands. His eyes started bleeding internally, turning the iris red, as the corruption slowly started blackening the sclera. His torture wasn't over yet. The corruption started turning his veins black, spreading from his eyes, to his face and neck and eventually to the rest of his body. No one could hear his cries of despair, no one could put an end to his torment. His eye sockets look like they where burned from inside out, barely distinguishable from the pools of shadow that he had left for eyes, and inside each one, a fading blood moon. Quickly his mind was affected aswell and his humanity was slipping away. Was it the curse, the pain, the horror, matters not.

            Left with only his primal insticts he run to the nearest woods, thick enough to cast a veil of shadow that would hide him form the sun, the outside world, the man he once was. This was the begging of his animalistic life where he would only hunt, kill and eat to survive. The moon was the only friend he had left, radiating its calming light upon him. He spent his brutal life hidding in the shadows and avoiding any bigger predators, humans would never dare set foot in such place. He adapted fast to the enviroment, he could see better in the dark, as there was not much day light, he could be one with the shadows and pass unnoticted by almost any creature, he could kill faster, taking advantage of his pray's weak spots and he could pick up footsteps from a decent distance. He might gotten used to this unconventional way of life but things would change one day. Was it fate, coinsidence, his ability to survive, no one knows.

            His body started changing. His nails where turning into claws. His teeth where turning predator like. This very curse that took everything from him, suddenly started giving back to him. He became stronger, faster, he could hear even the smallest sound from a great distance, his sight was more than perfect in night time. He exceeded all human boundaries and had become a creature of the night. He was becoming more and more aware of what he is and glimpses of his past life came back to him. As revealing theese long lost memories could be, he had lost all of his humanity and could not turn back. He embraced his new gifts. He would not just hunt to survive but to entertain him self as well. He had no need to adapt to the environment, his surroundings need to adapt to him now. His lust for blood would grow as the nights were passing by. He needed something more. He became addicted to fear, seeing the horor in his pray's eyes, but animals were not enough. Throught this transformation he gained some other abilities, one of those being the manipulation of sounds. Mimicking other voices he lured people in his woods, hunted them and sucked all the dispair they could offer before killing and feasting upon them.

            This led to some unwanted attention from a group of hunters, specialized in supernatural creatures but he was wasn't similar to anything they've seen before. One day a young female hunter, highly trained despite her age, started investigating on all the local missing people and that led her in the thick woods. As she was stepping inside his territory, he was lurking in the shadows and the hunter became the hunted. She fell victim to his manipulation and that quickly broke her down. The moment he realised what she was and why she was there, anger and hate filled his body. He decided to spread the curse on her and turn her into the animal he once was, the very thing she was trained to hunt, to kill, to hate. He knew this was only the begginng and more would come after him. It was time to leave this brutal but simple life and set foot once again to the world of humans, bringing the fight to them.
