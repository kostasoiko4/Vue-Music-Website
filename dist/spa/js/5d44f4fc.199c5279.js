Their family had a close connection to the church as they have been taking care of the local temples for generations, with his grandfather Michael, being the first of their line to become a cleric. Through the devotion shown by his father and grandfather and their popularity among the religious powerful, Bartholomeus was put in charge of their home basilica, with potential to climb even higher. Unfortunately Constantine grew up with his only family being his father, as his mother died in birth, and his grandfather of a common disease. Given the position of his family, he was lucky to be well educated and had a variety of books available to him, which he found great interest in from the very begging. He was involved in the rituals from a young age, as his father had intended for him to become a priest as well and succeed him, continuing their newly found family tradition. It wasn't hard to notice that he was the brightest among the children of his age, as he was always surprising his teachers with his view of the world.\n          ")])],1),a("q-item",[a("h7",[e._v("\n            As the years pasted Constantine grew and so did his appetite for knowledge. At his early teenage years he was the first of the altar boys, preparing all the necessities for the rituals and guiding the others. Given the growth he has shown and his potential, he was often taken to greater temples to help so that he could gain more experience for his later years. Fortunately there were a huge supply of books nearby these temples that he could feast upon and with his growing reputation among the orthodox circles he had access to most of them. Some times as he was devouring knowledge, he would roam through dozens of books, cross-referencing events and taking the most fascinating journey someone could take in that era. One day he stumbled upon a section that was usually locked, and in a burst of his immense curiosity he grabbed one of the oddest looking books on the self. It was nothing like he had ever read before, containing information about events he was familiar with, that was hidden away. Then he took a second book, and he found even more secrets. As he went to grab a third book he felt a rapid wack on the back of his head and shortly after he saw the headmaster shouting at him. He was followed by a priest that calmed him down and explained to the boy that this section was forbidden and only the highest of the priest had access to it, and that he had to be punished for what he did. That, however, did not stop his hunger, and he would often go to such sections in secret when there was no one around, usually right after the evening ceremony.\n          ")])],1),a("q-item",[a("h7",[e._v("\n            He began to expand his knowledge fast and with that his way of viewing things changed, he had found out that the world he lived in was nothing like it seemed, it was just a front and the truth was locked behind glass cabinets, who knows how much more was hidden. As he was often visiting places like that, he would spot such cabinets and when he had the chance he would go and take a couple of books and replace them with those widely available, remaining unnoticed. Some times he would go there in late hours and as he would read, he would overhear conversations amongst clerics that would justify what he was reading and the view he now had of the church. One of those times, as he left he passed through the temple area and saw a woman entering and approaching the high priest, she had come for confession. He remained hidden behind a door frame and within the shadows as he thought it would not be right to interrupt such ritual, and so he stayed there watching and listening to every word she said. When the woman finished, the priest asked her to kneel before him and pray, and she did so immediately. Slowly the priest started circling the woman and touching her during her prayer and as she was done, he started removing her clothes. The young teenage boy was watching as the priest started molesting the woman, he was terrified and rooted to the ground, he couldn't turn his sight away. Eventually the priest stopped and the woman left, so did the boy and no one even noticed he was even there, still holding three books he should not have in his possession.\n          ")])],1),a("q-item",[a("h7",[e._v("\n            At the time he was near adulthood he had seen so many things that he shouldn't have, and he had read even more. He bore witness to priests taking advantage of other people because of their power, molesting women, stealing peoples money, suppressing thoughts and at the same time they would speak of morals that they would not follow them selfs. The corruption, the filth and the rot inside the highest members of the orthodox church filled his mind with anger and hate, despising everything they ever taught to him and everything they said. He would often hear priest talking about such things and bragging like it was an accomplishment, while he was still a member of the church, he had nowhere else to go, so he decided to take advantage of the situation. He had found out things that no one should know, crusades, exorcisms, and burning against innocent people just for the benefit of the church. They would mask crimes like that so many times that it became part of their every day life, and they would continue preaching like they never happened.\n          ")])],1),a("q-item",[a("h7",[e._v('\n            One day he was in charge of the preparations in the great basilica, Hagia Sophia, as his father took the place of the priest that night, a common thing for him, and he grabbed the chance to unravel any mysteries it had hidden away. Not long after the end of the ceremony, as he was hiding and looking for information, a family came to the priest with their young boy. He knew the little one, as he had seen him in the streets with the other kids, but he stood alone, distant from the crowd. From the conversation they had, he realised that they had been taking the boy there for many years, hoping to "cure" him. They left the boy with the cleric, and they stood outside the temple waiting to escort him home after they were done. Without even letting the boy speak, without asking him anything the priest started rapping him. This happened every single week since he was but a child. He came out with visible scars and bruises, some fresh, some not and his parents would just cover him with a thin cloth and walk him home. This was the most horrendous and disgusting thing Constantine had ever seen, it filled him with absolute despair. Not only the parents knew what was happening, but they would continuously bring the traumatized child back, blindly believing a perverse man just because of his robes and his position in the church, his power. It was then he realized that this man was not his father anymore, he was never. This problem could not be solved by any way but only one. To rid the world of their existence. This was the final straw to an everlasting cycle of lies and corruption. Through the connections he had made over the years and the information he gathered he knew of a growing empire in the east. He found out that the Ottomans were heading their way and so it became clear to him. Constantinople needed to burn, so he could take his revenge for the crimes the church committed.

He was just watching as the city burned and turned to rubble. His work was done, and so he had no reason to stay there. He set foot outside the great walls and stumbled upon a fleeing crowd, everyone knew that he was the source of this catastrophe but as they were running in torment no one noticed him, except an old woman. She stood there in the middle of the mass staring at him. She knew him since birth as they lived nearby, and at that moment with the screams of her people being killed and burned alive, with the darkness of the ashen sky clouding his eyes and the moon on his back, she pointed at him.
